                <H1>EXPECTATIONS - SoyHenry</H1>
                <p>The reason I started studying at Soy Henry is because I already have an IT degree and I feel this gives me a solid base
                     to successfully complete the course.

                    I received a degree in IT from the University of Belgrano in 1993, then I worked for more than 20 years in the area of
                    Systems and communications in an oil company and with the need to change my work environment and update and increase my knowledge 
                    in other areas of my orientation, I found in Soy Henry the possibility of achieving these goals.
                    
                    My expectations in Soy Henry are:
                     - Learn to study and get new study habits
                     - Connect with new people who are in the same process and learn from them.
                     - Manage to finish the course and know how to learn new technologies later
                     - Learn how to get a job in this new environment
                     - Get a job that stimulates me to learn new technologies and allows me to grow within the company.</p>
